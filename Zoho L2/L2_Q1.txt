Given a long integer N, Check if the first half is equal to the second half.

1. For an odd digit count number, check if the sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit and the sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit is equal or not.
2. For an even digit count number, check if the sum of all digits to the left half and the sum of all digits to the right half is equal or not.

Input format:
10 <= N <= Long.MAX_VALUE
Output format:
If equal print "YES"
If not equal print "NO"

Sample Input 1:
N = 1234006
Output: YES 
Explanation: Total number of digits is N = 7. Middle digit is 4. LHS = 1+2+3 = 6 and 
RHS = 0+0+6 = 6. 
LHS is equal to RHS

Sample Input 2:
N = 123006
Output: YES 
Explanation: Total number of digits in N = 6. LHS = 1+2+3 = 6 and RHS = 0+0+6 = 6. 
LHS is equal to RHS

Sample Input 3:
N = 12
Output: NO 
Explanation: Total number of digits in N = 2. LHS = 1 and RHS = 2. 
LHS is not equal to RHS

Sample Input 4:
N = 123456
Output: NO 
Explanation: Total number of digits in N = 2. LHS = 1+2+3 = 6 and RHS = 4+5+6 = 15. LHS is not equal to RHS
